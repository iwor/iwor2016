Workshop summary
------------------------------
Successful software products evolve through a process of continuous changes as bugs are fixed,
new features added, and quality issues addressed. Refactoring supports the volatile
software lifecycle by providing better ways to reduce and manage the growing complexity of
software systems while improving developer productivity. Refactoring can be performed at all
levels from requirement specification down to source code level, and, in essence, involves
improving the internal structure of a software artefact without altering its functionality.
In spite of the popularity of refactoring both in practice and as a research topic, many open
questions remain, particularly in terms of understanding how refactoring is performed, measuring
the impact of refactoring, and improving tool support in all areas of refactoring.

We invite submissions from both academia and industry on any topic that is refactoring
related, including, but not limited to:

 - Source code refactoring
 - Requirement, design and architectural refactoring
 - Refactoring of mobile, web and cloud applications
 - Refactoring opportunities detection and recommendation
 - Tool support for refactoring
 - Mining refactoring changes from software repositories
 - Evaluation and benchmarking of refactoring methods
 - Refactoring in Model Driven Engineering
 - Code smell detection and correction
 - Search based refactoring
 - Effect of refactoring on system complexity and quality
 - Empirical studies and experience reports
 - Software remodularization
 - Model transformation
 - Introduction of design patterns through refactoring
 - Machine learning applied to software refactoring
 - Role of refactoring in evolution and migration
 - Refactoring in the software lifecycle
 - Refactoring and testing

Workshop format
------------------------------
The objective of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Refactoring (IWoR 2016)
is to provide an informal interactive forum for researchers and practitioners to
exchange ideas and experiences, streamline and foster research on software refactoring,
identify some common ground for their work, share lessons and challenges, thereby
articulating a vision for the future of software refactoring research.

We solicit four types of submissions: full research papers (max 8 pages), position papers (max 4 pages),
and tool demo papers (max 4 pages), and industrial presentation. Please check the website for more information.

Proceedings and Special Issue
------------------------------
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings in the ACM digital library.

A selection of the best papers will be invited to submit extended versions for tentative publication in a Special 
Issue of the journal Information and Software Technology published by Elsevier.
Journal website: http://www.elsevier.com/locate/infsof

Submission
------------------------------
All submissions must be formatted according to the ACM style (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates  
LaTeX users, use the style Option 2) and should be submitted through EasyChair at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwsr2016

Each paper will be reviewed by at least three referees.
